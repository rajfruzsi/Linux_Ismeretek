This repo contains the source code for my university project.
It has a shell script file that installs everything needed to run the python code. (Including Python itself).
The OCR folder has some test images that can be used for testing purposes of the OCR.
The gui has 2 buttons and an input text. The input waits for the image name with the right extension, for example ,,test1.jpeg" and
by pressing the first button it calls the recognition functions.
With the other button we can upload an image and start the recognition itself.
With both of these options a result file will be saved that contains the recognized text.
